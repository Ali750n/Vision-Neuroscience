This report investigates the reduced Wang decision model, replicating key figures and fitting the model to human behavioral data. By adjusting parameters, such as stimulus strength, threshold, and recurrent excitation and inhibition strengths, the model was fitted to replicate human decision-making behavior. The study enhances our understanding of decision-making processes and highlights the flexibility of the Wang model in capturing human behavior.
