This report presents an evaluation of the Itti saliency model’s performance in predicting human attention patterns compared to ground truth eye-tracking data. Natural images from a provided dataset were processed using the Itti saliency model to generate saliency maps. The fixation points of selected subjects were overlaid on these maps to assess the model’s accuracy. Additionally, the Gazerecorder tool was utilized to obtain human gaze locations on the images. Metrics such as Normalized Scanpath Saliency (NSS) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were employed for quantitative analysis. The results revealed that while the Itti model showed good alignment with human gaze data for some images, discrepancies were observed for complex scenes and high-level features. The study highlights the importance of considering both low-level and high-level features in attention models and provides insights into the strengths and limitations of the Itti saliency model.
